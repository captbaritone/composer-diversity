## About the project

The [Composer Diversity Database](/) was created to allow conductors, performers, presenters, educators, and researchers a tool with which to expand and broaden their scope of composers and repertoire.

In order to use the database, simply click one or multiple checkboxes at the top of the page. Each checkbox will filter only the names that fall under that category. Multiple categories may be selectedâ€”in fact, a search with several different filters (i.e. living-female-chorus-South Asian) may be the most efficient way to use the database.
